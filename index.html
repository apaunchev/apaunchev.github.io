<p>My name is Angel Paunchev, and I’m a web developer from Bulgaria.</p>

<p>I’m currently working full-time at <a href="https://www.spotme.com/">SpotMe</a>, developing a mobile platform that redefines the way events are done. In 2015, I graduated from <a href="http://www.gcu.ac.uk/">Glasgow Caledonian University</a> with a BSc in Computing.</p>

<p>I enjoy solving problems, learning, and constantly challenging myself. I’m fascinated by technology, science, and the various ways they are applied to push the human race forward.</p>

<p>I'm an <a href="/introvert">introvert</a>. I read books and collect my favourite ones in my <a href="/library">library</a>.</p>
