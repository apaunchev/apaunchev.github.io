<p>Hello! My name is Angel Paunchev and I’m a software developer from Bulgaria.</p>

<p>I’m currently working at <a href="https://www.spotme.com/">SpotMe</a>. In 2015, I graduated from <a href="http://www.gcu.ac.uk/">Glasgow Caledonian University</a> with a BSc in Computing.</p>

<p>I challenge myself through solving problems and learning. I’m fascinated by technology, science, and the various ways they are applied to push the human race forward.</p>

<p>I'm an <a href="/introvert">introvert</a>. I read <a href="/library">books</a> and <a href="/writing">write</a> about things that occupy my mind.</p>
