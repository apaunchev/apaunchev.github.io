    <h1>Angel Paunchev is a<br>web developer from Bulgaria.</h1>

    <h2>About</h2>

    <p>In 2015, I graduated from <a href="http://www.gcu.ac.uk/">Glasgow Caledonian University</a> with a BSc in Computing.</p>

    <p>I’m interested in software engineering, specifically for the web and mobile platforms. I have an eye for aesthetics and appreciate good design.</p>

    <p>I’m often fascinated by technology, science, and the ways they can be applied to push the human race forward. I’m determined to learn as much as I can about as much as I can.</p>
