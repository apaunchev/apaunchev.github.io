<p>Hi! My name is Angel Paunchev. I’m from Bulgaria.</p>

<p>I work at <a href="https://www.spotme.com/">SpotMe</a>, where we are transforming the event app industry. My job involves leading and growing a team of developers, as well as implementing enhancements to our core platform. In 2015, I graduated from <a href="http://www.gcu.ac.uk/">Glasgow Caledonian University</a> with a BSc in Computing.</p>

<p>I love solving problems and learning along the way. I’m fascinated by technology, science, and the various ways they are applied to push the human race forward.</p>

<p>Here you can also find <a href="/articles">articles</a> I have written, and <a href="/library">books</a> I have read and recommend.</p>

<p>Have something to say? <a href="mailto:apaunchev@gmail.com">Get in touch</a>.</p>
