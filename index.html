<p>My name is Angel Paunchev. I’m a web developer and student from Bulgaria.</p>

<p>Currently in the final (Honours) year of a BSc Computing course at <a href="http://www.gcu.ac.uk/">Glasgow Caledonian University</a>, researching API design, REST, and web performance.</p>

<p>I’m interested in software engineering, specifically for the web and mobile platforms. I have an eye for aesthetics and appreciate good design.</p>

<p>I’m often fascinated by technology, science, and the ways they can be applied to push the human race forward. I’m determined to learn as much as I can about as much as I can.</p>

<p>Most recently, I’ve been experimenting with iOS development and collecting <a href="http://photos.paunchev.net">Instagram photos I wish I had taken</a>.</p>
