excerpt: You should know about the difference between having a fixed mindset and having
  a growth mindset.
---

One of the most important concepts I’ve learned recently is the difference between having a fixed mindset and having a growth mindset.

People with a fixed mindset believe that if they are good or bad at something, it's because they were born that way and that’s just part of who they are.

People with a growth mindset believe that they can get good at anything, because their abilities are entirely dependent on their actions.

To illustrate this, let’s imagine there’s a difficult problem ahead of you and you don’t know how to solve it – you’ve hit a wall. If you have a fixed mindset, you will stop at the wall and give up, because you deeply believe you were not born to climb this wall. If you have a growth mindset, on the other hand, you will stop at the wall, but instead of giving up, you will come back the next day and try to climb it again. You will most likely fail, but the next day you will try again, and again, until you reach the top, or realise there had been a door in the wall all along, but you just hadn’t been able to see it.

In a fixed mindset, you tend to stay within your comfort zone, afraid of change or disapproval. In a growth mindset, you strive to push yourself into the unknown, always learning and improving.

In a fixed mindset, failures are devastating. In a growth mindset, failures are life lessons.

In a fixed mindset, you look for your passion and true calling within yourself. In a growth mindset, you realise you will find your passion by doing great work, and doing great work comes only with experience.

In a fixed mindset, the focus is on the destination. In a growth mindset, the focus is on the journey.

**Mindset itself is not fixed. It’s never too late to change it.**
