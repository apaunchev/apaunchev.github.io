For as long as I can remember, I’ve been recommending things I like to people around me. Films, sites, games, gadgets — everything. Most recently, I’ve been fascinated by all kinds of web services and other tech-related products which make my life easier.

I also follow a lot of tech blogs, and some of the more popular among them often have “sponsor posts”, i.e. paid posts advertising a product to the blog’s audience.

I’ve never felt the need to get paid just to talk about something I use, so I’ve decided to start publishing “non-sponsor” posts — short reviews and recommendations of products I enjoy using, without anyone actually sponsoring me.
