> Instead of blogging, people are posting to Tumblr, tweeting, pinning things to their board, posting to Reddit, Snapchatting, updating Facebook statuses, Instagramming, and publishing on Medium. In 1997, wired teens created online diaries, and in 2004 the blog was king. Today, teens are about as likely to start a blog (over Instagramming or Snapchatting) as they are to buy a music CD. Blogs are for 40-somethings with kids.

A valid point, although I wouldn’t go as far as saying that blogs are _dead_. They’ve certainly _grown up_ and _evolved_ into something different — they are now a “safe haven”, a place to publish content without worrying about Facebook’s privacy policy or Twitter’s terms of usage. And I like that.
