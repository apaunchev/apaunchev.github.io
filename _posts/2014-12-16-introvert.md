I’m an introvert. Here’s what you should know about it.

**Being an introvert means that interacting with people for extended periods of time exhausts me and I often need to be on my own for a while to regain my energy**.

Going to social gatherings can be extremely draining for me, especially if I have to be around people I don’t know. This is why I sometimes prefer staying at home to going out. I need a healthy balance between socialising and alone time.

Spending time alone does not make me lonely. There are a ton of things I can do when I'm on my own that make me happy, but like most people, I can only do them so long before craving interaction with another human being.

I don’t mind social interactions, but I usually don't initiate them either. In other words, I'm unlikely to start a conversation, but I’d be more than happy if you start one with me.

I don’t enjoy small talk; it feels fake and unnecessary. I’d much rather have meaningful conversations about things we’re both passionate about than tell you what I did last weekend. (Whatever it was, I was probably by myself, and I enjoyed every second of it.)

Introverted ≠ shy. I may be shy from time to time, as are a lot of people, but this has nothing to do with introversion.

I like silence. You might think I’m quiet and don’t want to talk, but it’s usually the exact opposite. I just use the silence to think and reflect. Having someone I can share these quiet moments with and not feel awkward about it is very important to me.

I don’t mind when you cancel plans. You have to be somewhere else and we can’t meet tonight? You’ve just made one introvert very, very happy. As [John Mulaney](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKaijlTs2Ns) puts it, “In terms of instant relief, cancelling plans is like heroin – it’s an amazing feeling”.

[Daniel Miles](http://www.quora.com/What-does-it-feel-like-to-be-an-introvert/answer/Daniel-Miles-2) has described what being an introvert is like a lot better than I can:

<blockquote class="pull-quote">
	<p>As an introvert, interacting with other people feels like exercise. I feel better about myself every time I do it; it makes me stronger and healthier. It also exhausts me, and if I do it too much I feel sore and cramped. But if I go too long without it, I feel sluggish and stifled. Ultimately, it is the space between that energizes and sustains me. And some days, I just don't feel like working out and would rather sit on my ass and read a book by myself.</p>

Being introverted (or extroverted, or anything in-between) is not a condition. It cannot be treated or changed, and there is nothing wrong with you; it is how your brain is wired.

Simply knowing this can be incredibly liberating.
