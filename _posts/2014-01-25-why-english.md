My native language is Bulgarian, yet my site is in English. Why?

I’ve always had the “language dilemma” when it comes to my online presence. If you follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/apaunchev) or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/apaunchev), you probably have noticed some of my posts are in English and others are in Bulgarian.

The reason for this dilemma is that I was never quite sure which “audience” I should target: my closest friends, relatives and other Bulgarians, which are the majority of people I know and relate to, or the much wider audience of… _everyone else_ (who speaks English). The latter group being much more appealing from a blogger’s perspective, of course.

A lot of the Bulgarians I know understand English, so they should still be able to read my posts, but the truth is I _want_ to use Bulgarian as well — it’s a great language, I want to preserve it, but most of all, it’s the language I’ve been using my whole life.

As to why this site is in English, I decided that if I was going to write on the topics of design, development, technology, and more, I might as well do it for a wider audience. It’s more practical _and_ I get a decent chance to practice and improve my written English skills.

I’m not sure if anyone ever cared about my language preference and the justifications behind it, but there you have it.
