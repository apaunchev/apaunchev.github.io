description: "My take on what hardware, software and services I use daily."
---

I enjoy reading about how other people work, what hardware and software they use, and what their daily workflows look like. Inspired by similar posts, I decided to give it a go myself.

My setup is constantly evolving and I’m always interested in trying out new toys and tools. This post will also be evolving as I update it periodically to reflect any significant changes to my setup.

    <p>Added a Bluetooth speaker and dedicated sections for Mac and iPhone software with some new applications in both. Next update is planned for the summer when I’m hoping to set up a proper workstation at home.</p>

## Hardware

I travel back and forth between Sofia and Glasgow every few months, so my hardware setup tends to be fairly mobile. The two primary devices which I use for work, entertainment, and everything else are my laptop and my phone.

### 13″ MacBook Pro with Retina display

My first ever Mac. Bought it in late 2013 and it immediately became my primary machine. Made me fall in love with computers all over again.

I went for the mid-range 13″ model which has a dual-core i5, 8GB memory and 256GB of storage, but perhaps its most noticeable feature is the Retina display – this thing has completely changed the way I look at computer displays.

Besides having excellent design and build quality, the 13″ MacBook Pro is also very portable. It’s a laptop I can easily carry around in a bag and barely even notice it being there.

The battery life is outstanding as well – I get around 7–8 hours with moderate usage, which is more than enough not to worry about carrying the charger with me at all times.

Sometimes I feel limited when it comes to screen real estate – after all, it’s just a 13″ screen, and coding often requires more space than that. But it’s nothing that a good external display (or two) can’t fix.

### iPhone 5s

Mostly used for communication and entertainment, but it complements my laptop perfectly. Having the same app ecosystem on my two primary devices saves both time and money.

As you would expect, the build quality is top notch. Again, one of the more noticeable features is the display – extremely crisp and detailed. Also, the perfect size for me; I wish Apple didn’t have to make it any bigger.

Battery life could be (much) better, but we all know how it is with smart phone batteries these days.

### Bose SoundLink Mini

The speakers on my laptop (or most any laptop, for that matter) aren’t exactly great – they lack clarity and power. That is why I decided to get a Bluetooth speaker, which would essentially replace them.

I went with the Bose SoundLink Mini. It has overwhelmingly positive reviews and is, by far, the best sounding portable speaker I’ve ever heard. Pricey too, but totally worth it if you want to listen to music the way it was meant to be listened to.

## Software

Software is an integral part of my life. Probably yours too; everything around us is run by software. Below is a list of my most frequently used services, which can be found on both my Mac and iPhone, as well as a list of applications that I use specifically on each device.

### Services

[Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com/). Most of my personal and work-related files are on Dropbox nowadays. I use its sharing and collaboration features all the time, and the automatic versioning gives me peace of mind. It really has become an indispensable tool in my daily workflow.

[1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword). Together with Dropbox, this is one of the most critical apps I use and can’t recommend it enough. If you want to stay secure online, a password manager is an absolute necessity these days.

[Mailbox](http://www.mailboxapp.com). Probably the closest to my ideal mail client. The only feature I still miss, and have to use Apple Mail for, is Exchange support, but it must be just around the corner.

[GitHub](https://github.com/). Most of my personal projects go on GitHub. I like having my code displayed publicly – it makes me go back to it every now and then and improve it.

[Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/). My preferred way of listening to music. I like the huge catalog and that I can access my music offline as well.

[Evernote](https://evernote.com). Random thoughts, project ideas, post drafts, and many more – they all live in Evernote.

[Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/). Sites and pages I like and want to see again in the future get archived on Pinboard.

[Twitter](https://twitter.com). The official apps do the job for me. Third-party clients are slowly falling behind the official ones due to API restrictions, which means that sooner or later they will no longer provide the full Twitter experience.

[IFTTT](https://ifttt.com). I’ve been interested in automation for a while now. IFTTT lets me connect social networks with one another, save stuff automatically to Evernote, organise my iOS screenshots, and more.

### Mac

[Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/). I prefer it because it’s fast, battery efficient and well integrated with OS X. Google Chrome handles video a lot better, though.

[Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/). My editor of choice. It’s fast, highly customisable, and has a huge community around it.

[iTerm2](http://www.iterm2.com/). My terminal emulator of choice. I’ve customised it to match Sublime Text’s colour scheme, so everything feels nice and consistent.

[Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/). I use it launch applications, find files, do math, perform system operations, convert units, and _a lot_ more. It’s like my personal assistant and I miss it anytime I use another computer.

[Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical). A great replacement for the native Calendar app. It lives in the menu bar, which makes it incredibly fast and easy to use (I launch it with a keyboard shortcut). I especially like the natural language input.

[iA Writer](http://www.iawriter.com/mac/). I do most of my writing/drafting in iA Writer. I like the simplicity of it. The less I worry about formatting, the more I get to actually write.

[f.lux](https://justgetflux.com). Adjusts the colour of your computer display to adapt to the time of day. To fully appreciate it, I’d suggest using it for a few days, turning it off for a minute, and then turning it back on, for good.

### iPhone

[Fantastical 2.](https://flexibits.com/fantastical-iphone) I’ve listed Fantastical above, but Fantastical 2 for iOS is in some ways different and worth mentioning again. It integrates nicely with Reminders, which I use for simple daily to-do lists.

[Sumptus](http://wesix.co). I’ve recently got into the habit of tracking my daily expenses. Sumptus has an intuitive interface with detailed, yet not overwhelming statistics, which let me see how much money I spend and on what.

[Overcast](https://overcast.fm). It has some interesting features such as Smart Speed and Voice Boost, which set it apart from the alternative podcast apps.

[Pedometer++](http://pedometerplusplus.com). My iPhone tracks my daily steps and Pedometer++ simply takes the data and presents it beautifully.

[Pillow](https://neybox.com/pillow/). Tracks my sleeping habits. A beautiful interface that really shines once you collect a few months of data. I like the non-intrusive alarm sounds, too.

[AppShopper](http://appshopper.com). I use it to keep a wish list of apps I’d like to buy in the future, hoping they would get discounted before then. It’s a shame the app doesn’t seem to be actively developed anymore, but it still works pretty well.

[Coach.me](https://www.coach.me/). I’m always looking for ways to grow by building new habits. Coach.me keeps a list of habits and reminds me about them daily. It’s highly satisfying to check things off that list at the end of each day.

[Calm](http://www.calm.com). Meditating is one of these habits I’m trying to build. Calm is a guided mediation app, which is perfect for beginners like me.
