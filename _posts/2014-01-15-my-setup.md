Inspired by [Harry Roberts’ article](http://csswizardry.com/2013/12/my-setup/), this will be my take on what hardware, software and services I use for work. I will mostly focus on developer tools, but will also cover some productivity and entertainment services that complement my development workflow.

## Hardware

I travel back and forth between Sofia and Glasgow every few months, so my hardware setup has to be very mobile. The two devices I use all the time are my laptop and my phone.

### 13″ MacBook Pro with Retina display

My first ever Mac. Bought it in late 2013 and it immediately became my primary machine. Made me fall in love with computers all over again.

I went for the mid-range 13″ model which has a dual-core i5, 8GB memory and 256GB of storage, but perhaps its most noticeable feature is the Retina display. It’s true what they say – once you go Retina, you can’t go back.

Besides having excellent design and build quality, the 13″ MacBook Pro is also very portable. It’s a laptop I can easily carry around in a bag and barely even notice it being there.

The battery life is outstanding as well – I get around 7–8 hours with moderate usage, which is more than enough not to worry about carrying the charger with me at all times.

Sometimes I feel limited when it comes to screen real estate – after all, it’s just a 13″ screen, and coding often requires more space than that. But it’s nothing that a good external display (or two) can’t fix.

### iPhone 5s

Mostly used for communication and entertainment, but it complements my laptop perfectly. Having the same app ecosystem on my two primary devices saves both time and money.

The phone itself is of very high quality, as you would expect from the brand. Again, one of the more noticeable features is the display – extremely crisp and detailed. Also, the perfect size for me; I wish Apple didn’t have to make it any bigger.

Battery life could be (much) better, but we all know how it is with smart phone batteries these days.

## Software

Software is an integral part of my life (and probably yours, too). Everything around us is powered by software. I use software to build software. These days, I can do most of my work from either a browser, a terminal emulator, or a text editor. More often that not, all three are open at the same time on my computer.

### Google Chrome

My browser of choice. Being mostly a web developer, I have to use other browsers for testing, but Chrome is the one that keeps my bookmarks, if you know what I mean.

### iTerm2

My terminal emulator of choice. I use it to traverse the file system, move files around, use Git, use package managers, and a lot more.

### Sublime Text

My editor of choice. It’s fast, highly customisable, and has a huge community around it. I also do all of my writing in it – using Markdown and the [MarkdownEditing](https://github.com/SublimeText-Markdown/MarkdownEditing) plugin. Other plugins I use: [BracketHighlighter](https://github.com/facelessuser/BracketHighlighter), [Emmet](https://github.com/sergeche/emmet-sublime), [SublimeLinter](https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter3), [GitGutter](https://github.com/jisaacks/GitGutter).

### Git

Most of the projects I work on are version controlled, and I use Git for that. I run it from the command line, because that’s what real men do. Right?

### Alfred

Alfred is a quick launcher – it can launch applications, find files, do math, perform system operations, and _a lot_ more. It’s almost like you have a personal assistant who’s always there for you, ready to help and make your workflow faster and more productive.

If you have the Powerpack, I highly recommend [zenorocha’s repository](https://github.com/zenorocha/alfred-workflows) for some extremely useful and high-quality workflows.

### CodeKit

CodeKit is an invaluable tool for front-end web developers. It compiles languages like Sass, Less, Stylus, CoffeeScript, and many more; it live-refreshes all of your browsers; combines, minifies and syntax-checks your JavaScript; optimizes images; adds CSS prefixes for you; the list goes on. All that power neatly packed and ready to use out of the box.

## Services

There are also several (web) services I make use of; some of them I pay for, others I use for free.

### Dropbox

I keep most of my files on Dropbox nowadays. Such a simple idea, and it’s implemented brilliantly. You get access to your files on every device, you can share and collaborate, and there’s even automatic versioning which has been very useful for me on a number of occasions.

### GitHub

Most of my personal projects go on GitHub. I like having my code displayed publicly – it makes me go back to it every now and then and make it better. I’ve also heard it’s good to have code online, so you can show it to prospective employers.

### Spotify

What would life be like without music? Boring, that’s what. Spotify makes it incredibly easy to listen to my favourite artists and playlists. Seriously, if you’re not streaming music by now, you _should_ be.

### Simplenote

A note taking app. I like it because it’s free, simple, and available on every platform. I take notes all the time. Seriously, I’m not sure if it’s a healthy habit any more.

That’s my current setup – very minimal, very mobile. I intend to continually update this article to reflect any future changes.
