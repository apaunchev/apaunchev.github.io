<h2>Timeline</h2>

<p>In 2011, I started a BSc Computing course at <a href="http://www.gcu.ac.uk">Glasgow Caledonian University</a>.</p>

<p>In 2012, I teamed up with <a href="http://oliur.com">Oliur Rahman</a> and we started making <a href="http://themes.theultralinx.com">themes</a>. That was also the year I started wearing glasses.</p>

<p>In 2013, I launched <a href="http://pravopis.be">pravopis.be</a>.</p>

<h2>This site</h2>

<p>I’ve had this site for over 5 years and its purpose has changed a lot over this time. At the moment, I use it as a place to showcase my recent work and to give perspective and insight on topics that interest me.

<p>It might sound selfish, but this site exists purely <em>for me</em>. It has helped me grow in many ways with each of its iterations. If it can do the same for you, I’d be more than happy.</p>

<p>Built with <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com">Sublime Text</a> and <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>. Source code is <a href="https://github.com/apaunchev/paunchev.net">hosted on GitHub</a>.</p>

<h2>Contact</h2>
